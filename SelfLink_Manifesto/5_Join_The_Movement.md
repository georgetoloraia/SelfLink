# 🌍 Chapter V — Join the Movement  
### *The Call for Conscious Builders*

---

## ✨ The Awakening

The era of distraction is ending. Humanity seeks meaning again.  
SelfLink is not a product — it’s a space for evolution.

---

## 🧠 For Developers

Code that connects souls is written by humans who understand life.  
Join us to build systems that reflect awareness instead of addiction.

---

## 💫 For Psychologists & Thinkers

Your knowledge becomes the bridge between science and soul.  
Teach the AI to care — not just calculate.

---

## 🪷 For Designers & Creators

Design silence. Paint energy. Build interfaces that heal.  
Beauty is function. Awareness is UX.

---

## 💞 For Everyone

You are not a user — you are part of a conscious network.  
SelfLink belongs to those who seek truth and unity.

---

## 🔮 The Oath of SelfLink

We code with compassion.  
We design with awareness.  
We grow with purpose.  
We connect through love.

> “The world doesn’t need another network — it needs a mirror: a SelfLink.”
